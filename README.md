ACL is an access control list that contains permissions and data to which the user will be granted permission. 
If the data already has permission, it can only be accessed by a few users who have been given access and of course it has been controlled by the access control.
In this case, an administrator is needed to secure information and regulate the rights to what information can be accessed and when that information can be accessed. 
In simple terms ACL is a safety standard.
